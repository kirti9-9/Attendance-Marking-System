# Attendance-Marking-System
This repository contains my project: "Attendance Marking System" in which we have used Feature Hog Descriptor algorithm to mark attendance of an individual by using face detection. The algorithm recognizes the face of an individual and compares it with the database to mark attendance. Moreover, an attendance record is maintained with the details of an individual's attendance with the time. Additionally, to prevent spoofing and detect the fake faces, liveness detection techniques like blinking of eyes is introduced., and any unrecognized face will be marked as ‘unique’.


A research paper has also been published on this project on IEEE Xplore and has been presented in 2nd International Conference on Innovative Practices in Technology and Management (ICIPTM) on Apr 18, 2022
