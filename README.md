# Attendance-Marking-System
This repository contains my major project attendance marking system in which we have used Hog Descriptor algorithm to mark attendance of an individual by using face detection. The algorithm recognizes the face of an individual and compares it with the database to mark attendance. Moreover, an attendance record with the details of an individual's attendance is also maintained. Additionally, to prevent spoofing and detect the fake faces, liveness detection techniques like blinking of eyes is introduced., and any unrecognized face will be marked as ‘unique’.


A research paper has also been written on this algorithm, which is yet to be published.
